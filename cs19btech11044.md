#LLVM/Clang

Clang is a good compiler for many languages and has the necessary infrastructure to build tools that makes it so special.

There are six classes of tokens: identifiers, keywords, constants, string literals,
operators, and other separators.

The c++ features supported by clang are tweaked wording, binary literals, basic iterations, inheritance etc

The benefits of clang are:-
* End-user benefits: fast compilation, low memory usage, gcc compatibility.
* Utility and applications: Library based architecture, supports diverse clients, integration with IDEs etc
* Internal Design and implementation: real world & production quality compiler, conformance with c/c++ etc

Examples:-
In PrintFunctionNames.cpp we see class hierarchy in class PrintFunctionConsumer.
Also, there is concept of protection in class PrintFunctionNamesAction.

In Attribute.cpp we see that thera are many structures which show support for abstraction and execption handling at many places.

In InitialPasses.cpp we see that there is data encapsulation using .h files which are called in the code.

In toy.cpp, we see there are various data structures used in class hierarchy to implement inheritance and there is also data encapsulation with use of .h files.

In AnnotateFunctions.cpp, we see that there are features of inheritance, function calling etc

In all exampes we see that all basic features of c++11/c++14 are thereas as clang now suports many features of c++20.

There is proper usage of iterations and recursion for implementation of various functions.
The commonly used data structures are stack, heaps etc

In all programs there is major usage of Inheritance, delegation, static polymorphism etc
Some of them are:-

* Inheritance: It allows switching implementation at runtime, store different objects (pointers, smart pointers or references) at the same container, defer method calls to specific implementation and allow a client code work with multiple different implementations at runtime.

* Delegation: It uses another object for implementing some functionality and forward a method call to it instead of inheriting the object class.

* Static Polymorphism: They are templates which are present in almost all .cpp files in llvm/clang examples.

* Type erasure: It is combination of static and dynamic polymorphism which provides optimal solution.

* Lambda functions: It adds new behaviours to objects at runtime, 

Clang has basically three phases:-
* The front end: It parses source code, checks for errors, and builds a language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the input code.
* The optimizer: It does optimisation on the AST generated by front end. 
* The back end: It generates the final code to be executed by the machine.

An Identifier can only have alphanumeric characters( a-z , A-Z , 0-9 ) and underscore( _ ). The
first character of an identifier can only contain alphabet(a-z, A-Z ) or underscore ( _ ). Identifiers
are also case sensitive in C. For example, name and Name are two different identifiers in C.

Some Identifiers are reserved for the use as keywords like int, for, if, typedef, etc.

Clang 11, the latest version, has full support for all published C++ standards and partial support for the C++20 standard.
